**PROJECT MACHINE LEARNING**
============================

- Hello world! welcome to my humble repository. Using python, my project implements the "Multi-class classification-based     algorithm" to create a software which identifies the cell type based on specific input cell characteristics.

**FOLDERS:**

- *project_raw_data:*
   contains "ram.xlsx" spreadsheet which holds the raw data (data set) in a column-row representation. This data is used to    train and test the classifier algorithm of the software.  

- *results:*
  contains the results of the test cases made along the development of the project. The result files are in ".txt"             format and named according to the dates it was conducted on.

- *source:*
  contains the python files: basic_functions.py, test_read_data.py and the software script ML.py.
  
- *Course_documents:
   contains course (MEDSCI_736) material including reflections, data management plan and exercises. 
  
- *Final assignment:* 
  contains a written report about the project's background, description of the data, an outline of the code used to           create the software. The report provides a reference for potential reuse/reproducibility of the code generated.

**BUILD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Algorithm: Machine learning - Multi-class classification - Decision tree classifier. 
- Programming language: python 3.5.2 | Anaconda 4.1.1 (64-bit).
